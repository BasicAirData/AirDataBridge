## Description

BasicAirData Air Data Bridge is a simple app to manage the BasicAirData Air Data Computer with your Android device.<br>
Using this app you can connect with the Air Data Computer on-the-field via Bluetooth and drive the device to do many things. For example you can view the air data in real time, start and stop the remote logging on the remote SDCard, set many parameters of the ADC and download your recordings.

This application is made to work with the BasicAirData [Asgard Air Data Computer](https://www.basicairdata.eu/projects/airdatacomputer/asgard-adc/).
